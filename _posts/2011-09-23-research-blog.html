In order to be open and collaborative with my research, I've decided to use this blog to post useful things I have learned in class and current research that I am working on. I would love to hear any feedback that you may have and I hope that my contributions will benefit some of you.

Here are some of the topics I will be talking about:
<ul>
	<li>Current grad school research (Electrical and Computer Engineering)</li>
	<li>Daily learnings from my classes</li>
	<li>Software development</li>
	<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
	<li>Beer and Wine</li>
	<li>And pretty much anything else I feel could help someone.</li>
</ul>
<div>Enjoy!</div>
